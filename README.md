### Blackjack-Simulator

A quite small Python project to simulate the famous 'Blackjack' game, including most of the rules used in casinos. 

The current game includes the following player decisions: 

* Hit: Player takes another card
* Stand: Player stands at current hand
* Double down: Player doubles initial bet and takes one last card
* Split: When starting cards have the same value, creates two hands from it. An initial bet is created.

### Future implementations

* Allowing the game to include more players, together with the new player decision of _insurance
* Implement a library (e.g. Pygame) to make it more visually appealing.
